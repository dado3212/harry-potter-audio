This tries to build a tool to replicate [thesocialgeekfamily from TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thesocialgeekfamily/video/7506354369470811422). You can choose from Easy (15s), Medium (10s), Hard (5s), and Impossible (1s) and get a random clip from one of the 8 movies. You have to guess which one it belongs to.

## Installation

### Web App
Create `config.local.js` and fill it with
```
window.BASE = 'http://<ip>:<port>';
window.TOKEN = '<token>';
```

## Running

### Web App
Just drag and drop the `index.html` file into your browser and you're good to go!

## Credits

The web app is almost entirely GPT 5 (pretty ideal use case for simple project with low standards and clearly documented APIs).
