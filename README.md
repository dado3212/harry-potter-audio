# Harry Potter Audio

This tries to build a tool for the guy from TikTok.

## Installation

### Web App
Create `config.local.js` and fill it with
```
window.BASE = 'http://<ip>:<port>';
window.TOKEN = '<token>';
```

## Running

### Web App
Just drag and drop the `index.html` file into your browser and you're good to go!

## Credits

The web app is almost entirely GPT 5 (pretty ideal use case for simple project with low standards and clearly documented APIs).
